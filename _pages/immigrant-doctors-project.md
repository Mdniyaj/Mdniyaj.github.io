# <center> Immigrant Doctors Project </center>
- - -

In response to the Trump administration's travel ban against individuals from several muslim countries, I co-founded the [Immigrant Doctors Project](https://immigrantdoctors.org/), which highlights the contributions of doctors who immigrated from the countries affected by the ban. Our work was covered widely in the media, including by CNN, NBC, Huffington Post, Vox, FiveThirtyEight, and the Boston Globe. I discuss the project in an interview with BYU radio [here](http://www.byuradio.org/episode/01e0c780-5621-4307-ba99-954c81776308?playhead=2440&autoplay=true).
