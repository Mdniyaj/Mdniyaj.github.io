I am a Senior Researcher in the Office of the Chief Economist at Microsoft. I will join the Brown economics department as an assistant professor in the fall of 2021.

My primary research interests are in econometrics. I am also interested in labor economics and the interplay of machine learning and economics.

I received my PhD in economics in 2020 from Harvard, where I was awarded the David A. Wells prize for best dissertation. I obtained a BA *summa cum laude* in mathematics and economics from the University of Pennsylvania.
